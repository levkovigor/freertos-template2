/**
 * @brief	This is the access class for array-type data pool entries.
 *
 * @details
 * To ensure safe usage of the data pool, operation is not done directly on the
 * data pool entries, but on local copies. This class provides simple type-
 * and length-safe access to vector-style data pool entries (i.e. entries with
 * length > 1). The class can be instantiated as read-write and read only.
 *
 * It provides a commit-and-roll-back semantic, which means that no array
 * entry in the data pool is changed until the commit call is executed.
 * There are two template parameters:
 * @tparam	T
 * This template parameter specifies the data type of an array entry. Currently,
 * all plain data types are supported, but in principle any type is possible.
 * @tparam  vector_size
 * This template parameter specifies the vector size of this entry. Using a
 * template parameter for this is not perfect, but avoids
 * dynamic memory allocation.
 * @ingroup data_pool

	 * @param set_id
