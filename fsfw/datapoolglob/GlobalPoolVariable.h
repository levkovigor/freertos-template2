 * @brief	This is the access class for non-array data pool entries.
 *
 * @details
 * To ensure safe usage of the data pool, operation is not done directly
 * on the data pool entries, but on local copies. This class provides simple
 * type-safe access to single data pool entries (i.e. entries with length = 1).
 * The class can be instantiated as read-write and read only.
 * It provides a commit-and-roll-back semantic, which means that the
 * variable's value in the data pool is not changed until the
 * commit call is executed.
 * 	@tparam	T The template parameter sets the type of the variable.
 * 	Currently, all plain data types are supported, but in principle
 * 	any type is possible.
 *	@ingroup data_pool
