 * @brief	This interface is used to control data pool
 * 			variable representations.
 * @details
 * To securely handle data pool variables, all pool entries are locally
 * managed by data pool variable access classes, which are called pool
 * variables. To ensure a common state of a set of variables needed in a
 * function, these local pool variables again are managed by other classes,
 * like the DataSet classes. This interface provides unified access to
 * local pool variables for such manager classes.
