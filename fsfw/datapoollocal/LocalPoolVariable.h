/**
 * @brief 	Local Pool Variable class which is used to access the local pools.
 * @details
 * This class is not stored in the map. Instead, it is used to access
 * the pool entries by using a pointer to the map storing the pool
 * entries. It can also be used to organize these pool entries into data sets.
 *
 * @tparam T The template parameter sets the type of the variable. Currently,
 * all plain data types are supported, but in principle  any type is possible.
 * @ingroup data_pool
